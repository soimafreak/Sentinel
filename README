#
#   ABOUT
#

Sentinel was concieved as an idea after contemplating some "quick fix" work carried out
on some production systems to ensure the application remained operational as much as possible.
The concept was orignially discussed on http://soimasysadmin.wordpress.com/2012/04/04/self-healing-systems/ 
and more information about the future of the application can be found on the site above.

#
#   Versioning
#

Major.Minor(Character increment) For example:

0.1     - Final release of 0.1
0.1(a)  - First feature release of final 0.1
0.1(aa) - Twenty seventh feature release of final 0.1

Non-character suffixed releases should be stable.

#

#
#   Notes
#

- In Addition to the features above It is becomming increasingly necessary to start considering some better
structures for storing the scores in.
- Also need to start splitting out the code into a bit of a structure or something... Not sure what this
will involve or best way toa chieve but something is needed...
