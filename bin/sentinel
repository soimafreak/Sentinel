#
#   Author:         Matthew Smith <soimafreak@gmail.com>
#   Site:           http://sentinel.soimafreak.co.uk/
#   Purpose:        Check health of a process through various means and keep said process operating correctly
#   Date:           27th March 2012
#   Explination:    Sentinel will carry out a number of checks on the health of the application / system 
#                   based on the outcome of these checks certain actions will be taken
#   Requires:       gem install -r log4r
#   Thanks:         http://angrez.blogspot.co.uk/2006/12/log4r-usage-and-examples.html
